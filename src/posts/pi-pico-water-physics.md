This project explores the intersection of embedded systems and physics simulation by creating a virtual fluid physics engine on the Raspberry Pi Pico. Using the MPU6050 sensor for motion detection and 60 LEDs for visual feedback, the system simulates an interactive "digital water balance" that responds in real-time to inertia, momentum, and friction.

The dual-core architecture of the Pi Pico enables simultaneous sensor reading and LED control, creating a smooth and responsive user experience.
