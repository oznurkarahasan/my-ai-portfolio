Wastewater treatment plants play a critical role in managing water resources and protecting the environment for a sustainable future. In modern times, ecosystems and global economies are threatened by climate change, water pollution, and numerous environmental issues. These wastewater treatment plants are essential for maintaining water quality and preventing contamination. However, the pumps, sensors, and other mechanical equipment used in these plants can deteriorate over time. Without regular monitoring, these deteriorations can lead to unexpected failures, resulting in plant shutdowns, unpleasant odors, and high maintenance costs. In the long term, wastewater contamination can lead to soil degradation, chronic disease outbreaks, significant economic losses, and social discontent. These effects can also contribute to environmental degradation and economic losses. In rapidly urbanizing areas and aging industrial zones, the risk of such failures can be particularly severe.
