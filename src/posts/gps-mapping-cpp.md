This study presents the design and implementation of a GPS-based mapping and path planning system developed using the C++ programming language. The system receives GPS data via the MAVLink protocol, performs noise reduction using a Kalman filter, stores route information in an SQLite database, and provides real-time map visualization with the OpenCV library.

Optimal path planning using the A* algorithm is also integrated into the system. The developed system addresses the critical need for real-time localization and path planning, which is crucial for autonomous vehicles, drone navigation, and robotic applications.
